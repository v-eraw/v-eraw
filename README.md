### Hi there, I'm Vera
Yes I was named after the fashion designer by a really cool cousin
-  Iâ€™m currently working on a productivity app called remindu-a calendar with a habit tracker dashboard thingy and like reminders + filterable lists 
-  I'm also working on some random game projects in Unity and C#
-  Here's my itch.io if you're interested in game projects: https://pudding-catcat.itch.io/
-  I'm trying to enjoy running, but my truest greatest passion in life is drowning myself in coffee, sitting in cafes, petting cats, + spending time in nature with friends/family
-  Fun fact: I LOVE harvest bowls and sweet potatoes
