### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a productivity app called Remindu + some small unity game projects: here's my itch.io if you're interested: https://pudding-catcat.itch.io/
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning more about web app development + creative writing
- ðŸŒ™ In my spare time I enjoy walking, kombucha chugging, reading about things that will never exist, and sleeping (I'm usually out like a light)
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: she/hers
- âš¡ Fun fact: my fav ice cream flavors are dad's cardamom by three twins and dalgona coffee by sweet alchemy. if you have the chance def reccommend checking out these flavors!
