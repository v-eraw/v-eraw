### Hi there, I'm Vera.
I was named after the fashion designer by a really cool cousin, but I'm not related
-  Iâ€™m currently working on a productivity app called remindu: a calendar with a habit tracker dashboard and reminders + filterable lists, that can track purchases and help with visualizing how you spend your money and time
-  I'm also working on some hobby game projects in Unity and C#
-  Here's my itch.io if you're interested in game projects: https://pudding-catcat.itch.io/
-  I'm trying to run more, but also I love cafes, + spending time in nature with friends/family
-  Fun fact: big fan of hot fruit tea boba, matcha lattes, egg benedicts, and top-down dungeon crawlers
