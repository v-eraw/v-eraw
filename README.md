### Hi there, I'm Vera
Yes I was named after the fashion designer by a really cool cousin and it's intentional.
-  Iâ€™m currently working on a productivity app called remindu that's supposed to help with time blindness and provide pushback on overly optimistic (but doomed) planning (i want to sprinkle machine learning into this-somehow) but bare-bones it's just a calendar with a habit tracker dashboard thingy and like reminders + some random game projects. I don't currently have a timeline for these things :/
-  Here's my itch.io if you're interested in game projects: https://pudding-catcat.itch.io/
-  I'm trying to enjoy running, but my truest greatest passion in life is drowing myself in coffee, petting cats, + spending time in nature with friends/family
-  Fun fact: I love harvest bowls
